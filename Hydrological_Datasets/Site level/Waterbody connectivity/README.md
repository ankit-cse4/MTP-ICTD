# Upstream-Downstream Waterbody Connectivity Dataset

## Overview
This dataset contains information about the connectivity between upstream and downstream waterbodies. It is designed to support hydrological studies and water resource management.

## Contents
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset files.
- **scripts/**: Directory containing scripts for data processing and analysis.
- **docs/**: Directory containing documentation and metadata.

## Data Description
The dataset includes the following variables:
- `waterbody_id`: Unique identifier for each waterbody.
- `upstream_id`: Identifier for the upstream waterbody.
- `downstream_id`: Identifier for the downstream waterbody.
- `connectivity_type`: Type of connectivity (e.g., direct, indirect).
- `distance`: Distance between connected waterbodies (in meters).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```
2. Navigate to the dataset directory:
  ```sh
  cd /Users/ankit/Desktop/MTP-ICTD/Hydrological_Datasets/Site\ level/Waterbody\ connectivity/
  ```
3. Load the dataset into your preferred analysis tool (e.g., Python, R).
